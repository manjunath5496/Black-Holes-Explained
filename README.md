<p>Do&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">black hole</a>s really exist? If they exist, why we haven't observed one hole yet? Can black holes be observed directly, and if so, how? If the production of the tiny black holes is feasible, can&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_accelerator" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">particle accelerator</a>s, such as the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Large Hadron Collider&nbsp;</strong></a>(<strong>LHC</strong>) in Switzerland at the famed&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>CERN</strong></a>&nbsp;nuclear laboratory create a micro black hole that will eventually eat the world? If not &minus; if there are no black holes, what are the things we detect ripping gas off the surface of other&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">star</a>s? What is the structure of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>space-time</strong></a>&nbsp;just outside the black hole? Do their space times have horizons? One of the key signature of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gravity" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">quantum gravity</a>&nbsp;would be the observation of a small&nbsp;<strong>quantum black hole</strong>?: are the major questions in theoretical physics today that haunts us. The effort to resolve these complex paradoxes is one of the very few things that lifts human mind a little above the level of farce, and gives it some of the grace of province inspiring new ideas and new experiments.</p>
<p>Most people think of a black hole as a voracious whirlpool in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">space</a>, sucking down everything around it. But that&rsquo;s not really true! A black hole is a place where&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">gravity</a>&nbsp;has gotten so strong that even&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">light</a>&nbsp;cannot escape out of its influence.</p>
<p><strong>How a black hole might be formed?</strong></p>
<p>The slightly denser regions of the nearly uniformly distributed&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">atom</a>s (mostly&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>hydrogen</strong></a>) which lack sufficient energy to escape the gravitational attraction of the nearby atoms, would combine together and thus grow even denser, forming giant clouds of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">gas</a>, which at some point become&nbsp;<strong>gravitationally unstable</strong>, undergo fragmentation and would break up into smaller clouds that would collapse under their own gravity. As these collapses, the atoms within them collide with one another more and more frequently and at greater and greater speeds &ndash; the gas heats up i.e., the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">temperature</a>&nbsp;of the gas would increase, until eventually it become hot enough to start&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>nuclear fusion</strong></a>&nbsp;reactions. And a consequence of this is that the stars like our sun (which are made up of more than one kind of gas particle) are born to radiate their energy as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>heat</strong></a>&nbsp;and light. But the stars of radius&nbsp;smaller than their&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Schwarzschild radius</strong></a>&nbsp;further collapse to produce dark or frozen stars (i.e., the mass of a star is concentrated in a small enough spherical region, so that its mass divided by its radius exceeds a particular critical value, the resulting&nbsp;<strong>space-time warp</strong>&nbsp;is so radical that anything, including light, that gets too close to the star will be unable to escape its&nbsp;<strong>gravitational grip</strong>). And these dark stars are sufficiently massive and compact and possess a strong gravitational field that prevent even light from escaping out its influence: any light emitted from the surface of the star will be dragged back by the star's gravitational attraction before it could get very far. Such stars become&nbsp;<strong>black voids</strong>&nbsp;in space and were coined in 1969 by the American scientist&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Archibald_Wheeler" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>John Wheeler</strong></a>&nbsp;"the black holes" (i.e., black because they cannot emit light and holes because anything getting too close falls into them, never to return). Classically, the gravitational field of the black holes (which seem to be among the most ordered and organized objects in the whole&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">universe</a>) is so strong that they would prevent any information including light from escaping out of their influence i.e., any information is sent down the throat of a black hole or swallowed by a black hole is forever hidden from the outside universe (this goes by the statement that "<strong>black holes have no hair</strong>" &mdash; that is, they have lost all information, all hair, except for these three parameters: its mass, spin and charge), and all one could say of the gravitational monster what the poet&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante_Alighieri" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Dante</a>&nbsp;said of the entrance to Hell: "<strong>All hope abandon, ye who enter here.</strong>" Anything or anyone who falls through the black hole will soon reach the region of infinite density and the end of time. However, only the laws of classical&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">general relativity</a>&nbsp;does not allow anything (not even light) to escape the gravitational grip of the black hole but the inclusion of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>quantum mechanics</strong></a>&nbsp;modifies this conclusion&minus; quantum fields would scatter off a black hole. Because energy cannot be created out of nothing, the pair of short-lived&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_particle" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">virtual particle</a>s (one with positive energy and the other with negative energy) appears close to the event horizon of a black hole. The gravitational might of the black hole inject energy into a pair of virtual particles ... that tears them just far enough apart so that one with negative energy gets sucked into the hole even before it can annihilate its partner ...&nbsp;<strong>its forsaken partner with positive energy</strong>... gets an energy boost from the gravitational force of the black hole ... escape outward to infinity (an abstract mathematical concept that was precisely formulated in the work of mathematician&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Georg Cantor</strong></a>&nbsp;in the late nineteenth century)... where it appear as a real particle (and to an observer at a distance, it will appear to have been emitted from the black hole). Because&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass%E2%80%93energy_equivalence" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">E= mc squared</a>&nbsp;(i.e., energy is equivalent to mass), a fall of negative energy particle into the black hole therefore reduces its mass with its horizon shrinking in size. As the black hole loses mass, the temperature of the black hole (which depends only on its&nbsp;<strong>mass</strong>) rises and its rate of emission of particle increases, so it loses mass more and more quickly. We don't know does the emission process continue until the black hole dissipates completely away or does it stop after a finite amount of time leaving black hole remnants.</p>
<p>Though the emission of particles from the primordial black holes is currently the most commonly accepted theory within scientific community, there is some disputation associated with it. There are some issues incompatible with quantum mechanics that it finally results in information being lost, which makes<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicist" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>&nbsp;physicist</strong></a>s discomfort and this raises a serious problem that strikes at the heart of our understanding of science. However, most physicists admit that black holes must radiate like hot bodies if our ideas about general relativity and quantum mechanics are correct. Thus even though they have not yet managed to find a primordial black hole emitting particles after over two decades of searching. Despite its strong theoretical foundation, the existence of this phenomenon is still in question. Alternately, those who don't believe that black holes themselves exist are similarly unwilling to admit that they emit particles.</p>
